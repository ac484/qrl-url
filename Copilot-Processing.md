User request: Address overlapping Cloud Scheduler-triggered Cloud Run calls causing repeated TLS/HMAC computation and CPU spikes. Must first audit architecture and flow, then provide root cause analysis and at least two optimization options (application/infrastructure/platform) without changing API contract, frequency, or adding deps. No code implementation until analysis delivered. Need to recommend a preferred solution and explain others.
